## Issues

One of the legacy issue is that all resources are not in the an asset
directory but are maintained under the bin directory. Thus it is dangerous
to delete or overwrite the contents under bin directory as it might erase
all assets. 

Another legacy issue is that the splash screen is incomplete due to lack of
resource and the screen after the gameplay finishes should be added as well.

This game might be refactored entirely in the future with a better design. It
is appealing to add another complete set of features in this RPG game.
